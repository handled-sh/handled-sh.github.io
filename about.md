# About Handled

Handled is your AI-powered personal assistant, available right inside WhatsApp and Telegram. No app to install. No account to create. Just a conversation that keeps your entire life on track.

## The Problem We Solve

The average person uses nearly ten different apps to manage their daily life — calendar, email, tasks, notes, reminders, banking, travel, and more. Each one is a separate silo with its own interface, its own notifications, and its own way of doing things.

The result is fragmentation. Important tasks fall between the cracks. Follow-ups get forgotten. Mental energy is wasted on managing tools instead of using them.

Handled eliminates this fragmentation by giving you a single, intelligent interface — your messaging app — that handles everything for you.

## What Handled Does

- **Daily briefings** — Wake up to a clear summary of your day: meetings, deadlines, tasks, and reminders.
- **Task management** — Capture tasks instantly by sending a message. Handled organizes, prioritizes, and reminds you automatically.
- **Calendar intelligence** — Schedule meetings, avoid conflicts, and manage your time without opening a calendar app.
- **Smart reminders** — Set one-time or recurring reminders in natural language. Never forget a bill, a birthday, or an appointment again.
- **Email and message triage** — Forward messages and emails to Handled. It extracts the important details and turns them into actions.
- **Proactive assistance** — Handled doesn't just respond to requests. It anticipates your needs and surfaces relevant information before you ask.

## Built for Real People

Handled is designed for people who are busy, not people who love productivity tools. You don't need to learn a new system, master prompt engineering, or change your habits. You just send a message — the way you already communicate with everyone else in your life.

Our users include freelancers, sales professionals, software engineers, small business owners, parents, students, and anyone who wants to spend less time managing their life and more time living it.

## The Team

Handled was founded by **Peter Larnholt**, an entrepreneur and technologist based in Copenhagen. Peter built Handled out of his own frustration with the fragmented tool landscape and a conviction that AI assistants should meet people where they already are — in their messaging apps.

The Handled team combines expertise in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, product design, and user experience. We are a small, focused team that moves fast and cares deeply about building something that genuinely helps people every single day.

## Our Values

**Simplicity over features.** We'd rather do fewer things exceptionally well than many things poorly. Every feature we add must make your life simpler, not more complex.

**Privacy by design.** Your personal assistant knows the intimate details of your life. We treat that responsibility with the seriousness it deserves. Data minimization, encryption, and user control are foundational to how we build.

**Meet people where they are.** We don't ask you to download a new app, learn a new interface, or change your behavior. Handled works inside the apps you already use, in the language you already speak.
