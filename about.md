Handled is an AI personal assistant that lives inside WhatsApp and Telegram. No app to download. No dashboard to learn. Just message it like you'd message a friend - and it takes care of the rest.

## The Problem

The average professional uses *nine different apps* to get through their day. Calendar here, email there, tasks somewhere else, notes in another corner. Every app has its own interface, its own notifications, its own way of demanding attention.

The result? Things slip through the cracks. Follow-ups get forgotten. You spend more time *managing tools* than actually getting things done.

We built Handled to fix that.

## How It Works

You send a message. Handled does the rest.

- **"What's on my calendar today?"** - Get a clear summary of your day
- **"Remind me to call the bank at 3 PM"** - Done, you'll get a nudge right on time
- **"Send an email to Sarah with the meeting notes"** - Sent from your account
- **"Check traffic to the airport"** - Live route with ETA and a map
- **"Find me a good Italian restaurant nearby"** - Curated results, not a list of links

Handled connects to your calendar, email, and contacts. It remembers your preferences, your routines, and the people in your life. The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

## Who It's For

Handled is built for busy people - not productivity nerds.

**Freelancers** who juggle clients, deadlines, and invoices across ten different threads. **Sales professionals** managing hundreds of contacts and follow-ups. **Engineers** who want to automate their personal life the way they automate their code. **Parents** keeping track of school events, appointments, and family schedules. **Anyone** who's tired of app-hopping and just wants things *handled*.

## The Founder

**Peter Larnholt** is an entrepreneur and technologist splitting his time between Copenhagen and Dubai. He built Handled out of personal frustration - too many apps, too many open tabs, too many things falling through the cracks.

His conviction: AI assistants should meet people where they already are. Not in another app. Not behind another login. Right there in the messaging apps you use every single day.

## Our Principles

**Simplicity over features.** We'd rather do three things perfectly than thirty things poorly. Every feature must make your life simpler.

**Privacy by design.** Your assistant knows the details of your life. We treat that responsibility seriously - data minimization, encryption, and user control are non-negotiable.

**Meet people where they are.** No downloads. No onboarding flows. No behavior change required. Handled works inside the apps you already use.
