I'm Peter Larnholt - a Swedish technology executive based in Dubai.

With 30+ years in telecom and technology, I've held leadership roles at companies like du (EITC), Millicom/Tigo, Yoigo, Ericsson, and TeliaSonera. Most recently, I served as Technology Advisor on the Executive Committee at Tamkeen in Bahrain.

I'm passionate about AI, digital transformation, and building things that matter. Currently working on [Handled](https://handled.sh) - a personal AI assistant.

This blog is where I share personal thoughts on technology, leadership, and life.
