I've used a lot of technology in my career. Servers, enterprise systems, data centers, telecom infrastructure worth hundreds of millions. Devices that run on every operating system imaginable.

But there is one brand I keep coming back to. Have kept coming back to, for twenty years. Apple.

## It just works

I know that sounds like a cliché. But when you've spent as long as I have dealing with technology that *doesn't* just work — enterprise software with a thousand dependencies, legacy systems that need three consultants to reboot, Android devices that feel slightly different every six months — you develop a genuine appreciation for things that do.

My MacBook opens and it's ready. My iPhone connects to everything seamlessly. My AirPods switch between devices without a thought. The whole ecosystem just flows, and after a full day of meetings and decisions, the last thing I want is for my laptop to fight me.

## Design that respects you

There's a philosophy behind Apple products that I think gets underappreciated. Every unnecessary thing has been removed. The trackpad on the MacBook is enormous and flawless — no buttons, no gimmicks, just precision. The keyboard has exactly the keys it needs. The screen is exactly as bright as it should be.

You might think that's obvious — that all laptops should work this way. But use a few of the alternatives and you'll quickly remember that it isn't obvious at all.

Apple designs things as if the person using them matters. As if their time and attention are worth protecting. I find that refreshing. And as someone building a product at Handled with that exact same philosophy — removing friction, simplifying the experience, meeting people where they are — I feel an alignment with what Apple has always stood for.

## The ecosystem is the product

I use a MacBook, an iPhone, AirPods, and an Apple Watch. They work together so naturally that I've stopped thinking about any of them individually. They're just one seamless thing that helps me move through the day.

That's the real Apple product: not any single device, but the experience of them all working together. Handoff, AirDrop, Continuity — these aren't features, they're a philosophy. And it's a philosophy that says your technology should get out of the way and let you live your life.

Which, come to think of it, is exactly what Handled is trying to do.

## A personal loyalty

I've recommended Apple to my family, my colleagues, and anyone who asks. Not because I'm brand loyal in some uncritical way — I'll use whatever works best. But after twenty years of testing everything else, Apple keeps winning.

My MacBook is sitting in front of me as I write this. Screen off for a moment, but instantly ready when I need it. That quiet reliability is worth more than any spec sheet.

That's why I love Apple.
