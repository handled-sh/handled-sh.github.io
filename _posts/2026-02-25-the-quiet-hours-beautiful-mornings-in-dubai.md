There is a version of Dubai that most people never see.

It exists between roughly 5:30 and 8:00 in the morning. Before the city wakes up, before the heat arrives, before the noise begins. The light is different at this hour — golden and soft, coming in sideways through the towers, catching the dust in the air and turning it into something almost beautiful.

I've lived in Dubai Marina for several years now. And the mornings are still the thing I love most about this city.

## The stillness before the heat

By 10 AM, Dubai is in full swing. The roads are busy, the temperature is climbing, the energy of the city is loud and relentless. It is exhilarating — but it doesn't leave much room for quiet.

The mornings are different. The air is cool enough to sit outside. The marina is still. You can hear the water. The towers that will soon be reflecting a blinding noon sun are instead catching a warm amber glow, and for a moment this city of glass and steel feels almost soft.

I take my coffee by the window. Some mornings I sit in the lounge — a quiet corner with armchairs and that particular quality of morning light that makes you feel like you have hours ahead of you. Which you do. That's the point.

## What I think about at this hour

I grew up in Sweden, where mornings in winter are dark. You wake up, and the world outside is black. The sun won't show up for hours. There's something character-building about that — but there's also something quietly draining.

Here, the sun rises early and it rises *completely*. There's no ambiguity about it. By 6:15 AM, the sky is bright and the day has begun. That certainty does something good to your psychology. You wake up, and the world is already lit up and ready.

I do some of my best thinking in these hours. No meetings yet. No messages to reply to. Just coffee, light, and whatever is on my mind.

Lately it has been the blog, work on Handled, ideas that surfaced during sleep and need somewhere to land before they disappear. I text them to myself — or more often to Handled — and by the time the working day starts, I have something to work with.

## The city as backdrop

Dubai's skyline at dawn is genuinely one of the most striking things I've seen anywhere in the world. And I've lived in Miami, Madrid, Stockholm and Copenhagen — I don't say that lightly.

There's something about the scale of it. The towers go up so high that on hazy mornings the tops disappear. The water catches the sky. The cranes — and there are always cranes — look almost elegant in silhouette against the early light.

It's a city still under construction. That feels right to me. I like being somewhere that's still becoming what it's going to be.

## A small ritual

Every morning I try to spend at least twenty minutes doing nothing in particular. Just sitting. Watching the light change. Letting thoughts arrive without chasing them.

It sounds indulgent. But I've found it makes everything that follows go better. The meetings are sharper. The decisions are clearer. The day feels chosen rather than just happening.

If you ever find yourself in Dubai, set an alarm for 6 AM. Walk down to the marina. Get a coffee somewhere quiet with a view of the water.

You'll see a different city. One worth knowing.
