I moved to Dubai in 2019. At the time, it felt like a big leap. A new city, a new role, a new chapter. What I didn't expect was how quickly it would start to feel like home.

Seven years later, I still get that feeling sometimes when I walk along the Marina in the morning. There's something about this city that's hard to explain to people who haven't lived here. It moves fast, it buzzes with energy, and yet it has a rhythm to it that you either find or you don't. I found it early, and I haven't looked back.

## Old friends, good coffee

This morning I had coffee with Marc Veelenturf, who heads up Atos across the Middle East and Turkiye. Marc has been in Dubai since 2008, which makes him practically a veteran by this city's standards.

We caught up on AI, the industry, what's changing and what's not. The kind of conversation that happens naturally when two people have been around long enough to have real context on things. No slides. No agenda. Just good coffee and honest talk.

That's one of the things I genuinely love about living here. The concentration of smart, experienced people who've chosen Dubai for the same reasons you have. You don't have to look far to find someone worth talking to. The network here is dense, in the best possible way.

You don't bump into people like this everywhere. In Dubai, you do.

## Ramadan in the city

Tonight, we're breaking fast at Al Khaima. It's Ramadan, and there's a special feeling to the city this time of year. Quieter during the day, alive in the evenings.

The Iftar table has a way of slowing everything down. You sit, you eat, you talk. Family first. Everything else can wait.

Maria and the boys will be there. These are the moments I'll remember. Not the meetings, not the deals, not the flights. The evenings by the water with the people who matter.

## Still worth it

Dubai isn't perfect. Nowhere is. But it has given me something I didn't know I was looking for when I packed my bags in 2019. A place where work is interesting, the weather is predictable, and old friends are never more than a coffee away.

If you're on the fence about it, stop being on the fence.
