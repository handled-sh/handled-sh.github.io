![Handled - Your Productivity Assistant](/assets/images/handled-hero.jpg)

There's a moment, maybe you're on top of a mountain, maybe you're in the back of a cab, maybe you're just sitting on your couch, when you pick up your phone and everything just *works*.

No switching between seven apps. No digging through email threads. No forgotten tasks haunting you at 2 AM.

Just one conversation. One assistant. Everything handled.

## What Is Handled?

Handled is a productivity assistant that lives where you already are: WhatsApp or Telegram. No new app to download, no dashboard to learn, no onboarding flow to endure.

You text it like you'd text a friend. And it does the rest.

- Schedule a meeting? Done.
- Check your calendar for tomorrow? Here it is.
- Send an email to your team? Sent.
- Remind you to call your mom at 7 PM? You'll get a nudge right on time.
- Look something up and send you a summary? Already in your inbox.

## Why It's Different

Most productivity tools ask you to change your behavior. Install this app. Learn this interface. Build this workflow.

Handled meets you where you are. It adapts to *your* life, not the other way around.

> "I used to spend my mornings triaging emails and juggling calendar invites. Now I just text Handled and my day is organized before my first coffee."
> - Sarah K., Freelance Designer

## Built for Real Life

Handled isn't a chatbot that answers trivia questions. It's a productivity assistant that actually *does things*:

- Connects to your Google Calendar, Outlook, and Gmail
- Sends emails on your behalf
- Tracks your tasks and deadlines
- Gives you morning briefings tailored to your day
- Monitors flights, prices, and anything you need to stay on top of
- Remembers your preferences, your contacts, your routines

It gets smarter the more you use it. And it never forgets.

## Try It Free

Handled is free for 90 days. No credit card. No commitment. Just text and go.

Your life is complicated enough. Your assistant shouldn't be.
