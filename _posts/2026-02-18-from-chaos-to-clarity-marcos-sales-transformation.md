Marco T. runs a sales team of five at a mid-size SaaS company in Milan. On any given day, he's personally managing relationships with over 200 active contacts - prospects, existing clients, partners, and internal stakeholders. Before Handled, his system for keeping track of all of them was a combination of sticky notes, a CRM he rarely updated, and sheer willpower.

> "I'd be on a call with a prospect and realize I couldn't remember what we discussed last time. I'd scroll through WhatsApp looking for the thread, then check email, then check Salesforce. By the time I found it, the moment was gone."

## Death by a thousand tabs

Marco's problem wasn't a lack of tools. He had plenty - a CRM, a calendar, a task manager, email, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn. The problem was that none of them talked to each other, and updating all of them after every interaction was a full-time job in itself.

The result? His CRM was always out of date. Follow-ups slipped. And deals that should have closed quietly died in his pipeline.

"I did the math once," Marco told us. "I was spending about 90 minutes a day just on data entry and tool maintenance. That's seven and a half hours a week - almost a full workday - doing nothing productive."

## A new approach

Marco discovered Handled through a colleague who used it for personal task management. Curious, he decided to try it for his sales workflow. The setup was simple: he connected Handled through Telegram, his preferred messaging app.

Within the first week, Marco had built a workflow that transformed how he operated:

### Before every call
Marco sends a quick message: "Brief me on Acme Corp." Handled pulls together everything it knows - the last conversation summary, any pending action items, the deal stage, and relevant notes. All delivered in a clean, scannable format, right in Telegram.

### After every call
Marco voice-notes a quick summary: "Just spoke with Elena at Acme. They want a revised proposal by Friday. Budget is 45K, up from 40K. She's looping in their CTO for the next call." Handled parses this, creates the follow-up task, updates the contact notes, and sets a reminder for Thursday to prepare the proposal.

### Every Monday morning
Handled sends Marco a weekly pipeline review: deals that need attention, follow-ups that are overdue, and contacts he hasn't reached out to in a while. No more surprises.

## The transformation

After three months, the results were striking:

- **Follow-up rate:** Increased from 60% to 95%. Almost nothing falls through the cracks anymore.
- **CRM accuracy:** Marco's notes are always current because Handled updates them automatically from his conversation summaries.
- **Deal velocity:** Average time-to-close dropped by 18%. Marco attributes this to faster follow-ups and better-prepared calls.
- **Weekly time saved:** Roughly 7 hours per week on administrative tasks.

But the metric Marco cares about most is simpler than any of those:

> "I don't dread Monday mornings anymore. I used to open my laptop and feel this wave of anxiety about what I'd forgotten over the weekend. Now I open Telegram, read my briefing, and I know exactly where everything stands. It's like having a chief of staff who never sleeps."

## What makes this work

Marco's story illustrates something important about how productivity tools create value. It's not about replacing human judgment - Marco still makes every strategic decision about his deals. It's about eliminating the friction between decisions.

The gap between "I should follow up with Elena" and actually doing it used to be filled with app-switching, data entry, and mental overhead. Handled compresses that gap to near zero.

## For sales teams everywhere

If you're in sales and spending more time on admin than on actual selling, you're not alone, and you don't have to accept it. Handled works with the tools you already use, meets you in the messaging apps you already have open, and handles the busywork so you can focus on what actually closes deals: building relationships.

Marco put it best: "Handled didn't make me a better salesman. It just removed everything that was getting in the way of being one."
