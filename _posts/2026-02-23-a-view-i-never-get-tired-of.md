There's something about Dubai Marina at night that never gets old.

The lights reflecting off the water, the yachts bobbing gently below, the hum of the city carrying up through the glass — I've looked at this view hundreds of times from our apartment in Grosvenor House Tower 2, and it still stops me for a moment every single time.

Soon enough, summer will arrive and we'll trade this skyline for something very different — the quiet forests and cool air of our house in Sweden. Two worlds, and I'm lucky enough to call both home.

But for now? This view will do just fine.
