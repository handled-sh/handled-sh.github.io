Sarah K. is a freelance graphic designer based in Amsterdam. She works with clients across three time zones, juggles invoices in two currencies, and manages her own calendar, bookkeeping, and client communications — all before her first cup of coffee.

When we first spoke with Sarah, she described her mornings like this:

> "I'd wake up, check WhatsApp for client messages, then switch to email, then check my calendar, then open my invoicing app, then go back to WhatsApp to reply. By the time I actually sat down to design, it was 11 AM and I was already exhausted."

Sound familiar? For millions of freelancers, the "business of freelancing" consumes more energy than the actual work.

## The breaking point

Last November, Sarah missed a deadline — not because the work was hard, but because she forgot about it. A client had sent the brief via email, she'd mentally noted it, but it never made it into her task list. The project fell through a crack between her inbox and her calendar.

"That was my wake-up call," Sarah told us. "I realized I was spending more time managing my tools than doing my job."

## Enter Handled

Sarah started using Handled in December 2025. She connected it through WhatsApp — the app she already had open all day.

Here's what changed:

- **Morning briefings, delivered automatically.** Every day at 7:30 AM, Handled sends Sarah a summary of her day: upcoming deadlines, meetings, and any tasks that need attention. No app-hopping required.
- **Client messages, triaged instantly.** When a client sends a new brief or revision request, Sarah forwards it to Handled. It extracts the key details, creates a task with the deadline, and adds it to her schedule.
- **Invoice reminders she doesn't have to think about.** Handled tracks her outstanding invoices and nudges her when one is overdue — or nudges the client, if she prefers.
- **Calendar conflicts, caught before they happen.** When Sarah tries to book a new client call, Handled checks for conflicts and suggests alternatives. No more double-bookings.

## The results

After eight weeks with Handled, Sarah tracked her time and found something remarkable: she was saving an average of **two hours per day** on administrative tasks.

But the numbers only tell part of the story. Here's what Sarah said when we caught up with her in February:

> "It's not just about the time. It's about the mental space. I used to carry this constant low-level anxiety — did I forget something? Did I reply to that email? Now I trust that Handled has it covered. I wake up, read my briefing, and start designing. That's it."

## What freelancers can learn from Sarah

Sarah's story isn't unique. We hear variations of it every week from freelancers, consultants, and solo entrepreneurs who are overwhelmed not by their work, but by the infrastructure around it.

The pattern is almost always the same:

1. **Too many tools.** Calendar here, tasks there, invoices somewhere else, messages everywhere.
2. **Too much context-switching.** Jumping between apps breaks focus and drains energy.
3. **Too little trust.** Without a reliable system, everything lives in your head, and your head is not a database.

Handled solves all three by meeting you where you already are — in your messaging app — and quietly handling the rest.

## Try it yourself

If Sarah's story resonates with you, give Handled a try. It takes less than two minutes to get started, and there's nothing to install. Just send a message and let your productivity assistant take it from there.

Your mornings deserve better than admin work.
