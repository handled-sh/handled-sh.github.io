This is what I see when I step outside in the morning. The sun coming up over Dubai Marina, golden light cutting through the haze between the towers, the water still and calm below. It's February - and it's already warm.

Back in Sweden, it's minus five right now. The sky went dark at half past three yesterday afternoon. The snow is beautiful, sure. But the darkness? That takes something out of you. Slowly. Quietly. Every year.

## Where I come from

I grew up in Sweden. I love it - genuinely. The summers are magical. Midsommar, the archipelago, the endless daylight that makes 10 PM feel like noon. Swedish nature is among the most beautiful in the world. The forests, the lakes, the silence.

And winter has its own charm. There's a coziness to the dark months - *mys*, as we say. Candles in every window. Coffee that never stops pouring. The first snow, when everything goes quiet and the world feels brand new.

But somewhere around January, the charm wears thin. The sun rises at nine and sets at three. You commute in darkness both ways. Your body craves light it's not getting. You layer up just to take the bins out. And you start counting the weeks until spring like a prisoner marking the wall.

I did that for over thirty years.

## The move

Moving to Dubai wasn't about escaping Sweden. It was about choosing a different rhythm. A place where the sun shows up reliably. Where you can sit outside in February. Where the energy of the city matches the pace I want to live and work at.

Dubai surprised me. Before I moved, I expected glass and glam - impressive but shallow. What I found was something else. A city full of people from everywhere, building things, taking chances, living without the weight of tradition telling them how things should be done.

It's imperfect. It's loud. It's occasionally absurd. But it's *alive* - in a way that charges you up instead of wearing you down.

## Two homes

Here's the thing people don't always understand about leaving your country: you don't stop loving it. You love it differently.

I appreciate Sweden *more* now. Every trip back feels like a gift. The clean air hits you the moment you land. The forests smell like childhood. The quality of life, the design sensibility, the quietness - you notice it all with fresh eyes when you've been away.

And when I come back to Dubai, I appreciate this too. The sunrise over the Marina. The energy. The warmth - literal and otherwise. The feeling of being in a city that's still writing its story.

I don't think you have to choose one home. Some of us are built for two.

## Why this matters

I built [Handled](https://handled.sh) from Dubai, for the world. Many of our early users are expats like me - people split between time zones, managing calendars in two countries, juggling family in one place and work in another. People who need an assistant that understands that life isn't lived in one neat timezone.

When I text Handled at 7 AM Dubai time, it knows it's 4 AM in Stockholm. It knows my mum's birthday is coming up and that I need to book flights. It knows my meetings are in Gulf time but my electricity contract is in CET.

That's not a feature. That's empathy. And it's something I could only have built by living this life myself.

## The view from here

I took the photo at the top of this post this morning. It's nothing special - just another Monday sunrise over the Marina. But to a Swedish kid who spent half the year in the dark, it still feels like a small miracle.

I'm grateful for both my homes. The one that raised me, and the one that woke me up.
